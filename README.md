# Custom Image Mapbox

This folder mirrors the location section's map + amenities layout exactly as it appeared in the Arc site. The map area stays prominent while the amenities and notes sit in responsive cards below.

- The top half mimics the Mapbox hero canvas (here using gradients for the visual).
- The grid of detail cards keeps the same typography but with neutral content.

Open `index.html` to explore the layout.
